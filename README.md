# Student Performance Analysis - DS4200 Project

This repository contains an analysis of student performance factors, exploring relationships between various demographic factors, learning disabilities, school types, and academic outcomes.

## Project Overview

Our analysis focuses on understanding the different factors that influence student performance. Through interactive visualizations, we explore:
